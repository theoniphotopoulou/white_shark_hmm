# white_shark_hmm
HMM analysis of ARGOS satellite tracking data from 33 white sharks tagged in South Africa

This repository contains the functions and scripts used for analysing white shark tracking data using hidden Markov models. The rationale for the analysis is presented in detail in "Sex and size influence the spatiotemporal distribution of white sharks, with implications for interactions with fisheries and spatial management in the southwest Indian Ocean" by Alison Kock, Amanda T Lombard, Ryan Daly, Victoria Goodall, Michael Me√øer, Ryan Johnson, Chris Fischer, Pieter Koen, Dylan Irion, Enrico Gennari, Alison Towner, Oliver Jewell, Charlene da Silva, Matt Dicken, Malcolm Smale, Theoni Photopoulou (2021). 

The data are read in and cleaned in script "01satellite_data.R", the HMMs are fitted in script "02momentuHMM_models.R" and the plots are produced in script "03ARGOSshark_plot_results.R".

The data, output and figures are not available in this repo while the work is under review for publication. The dataset used in the analysis will be available at the following URL <10.5281/zenodo.5575189> upon publication.

Please contact Theoni Photopoulou at <theoni.photopoulou@gmail.com> with any questions about the code and the data format.
